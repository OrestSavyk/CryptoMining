            <p class="faq-blok-title">Why do you consider CryptoMining. Tools to be the best profitability
                calculation software?</p>
            <p>We like to think our free software for calculating bitcoin mining
                profit is the best for many reasons. But, in short, we dont just use the 
                same old crappy APIs that all of the other copied-and-pasted
                calculators out there are using. We`ve built our tools from the 
                ground up to be the most reliable, available and accurate in the 
                industry. We also are working on providing access to our own API
                that will allow you to implement our tools into your own websites or apps.

            <p>There are many place online that sell mining gear, but you need to
                be very careful to find the right sellers. CryptoMining. Tools has 
                partnered with the <a>ASIC Miner Announcements</a> channel on 
                Telegram to provide you with a good starting place for finding 
                trusted sellers with available gear for sale. We always recommend 
                using a professional escrow service when buying mining
                equipment. The internet is ripe with scammers, especially in the  
                crypto space. Please be careful, and also pass your buying 
                decisions by other people in a public chat group before sending
                anyone your hard-earned bitcoin.
